## ðŸ“… [2025-08-15] - Inject comment to a file 

### ðŸ§ª Observation / What I Tried
- âœ… Explore function of the `commentMap`
- âœ… Modify existing comment inside a file
- âœ… Add comment above a func.
---

### âœ… Decisions

- Previous issue was fixed:
    If adding a new comment, the comment would create a new line; instead, it is now injected with the previous line.
    There is no proper solution for inserting an empty line directly into source code yet.
    So when the function doesn't have space between the previous node, it will add a blank comment to it.
    This is done by adding a new `// ` empty comment for the first part,
    so even if there is no space between two nodes, it only has an empty comment that has a noticeable impact.

    **Before:**
    ```go
    type data struct {
    }
    func SomeFunc() {
            fmt.Println("this is a function")
    }
    ```

    **After:**
    ```go
    type data struct {
    } //
    // first
    // second
    // third
    // fourth
    func SomeFunc() {
            fmt.Println("this is a function")
    }
    ```
