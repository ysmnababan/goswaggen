## 📅 [2025-07-11] - Learn GO/PACKAGE

### 🧪 Observation / What I Tried
- ❌ Get the function who use the handler with ast
- ✅ Experiment with `ast/package`
- ❌ Try to run the tools from the handler directory, but it couln't find the main function easily

---

### ✅ Decisions
- Use `go/package` for searching through the files 
- Run the tools from where the main package is located . If it not from the main dir, user must provide
  the location of the `main.go` (which is not recommended)
