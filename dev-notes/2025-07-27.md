## 📅 [2025-07-27] - Try to parse the func body

### 🧪 Observation / What I Tried
- ✅ Try to find capability of `c.bind` in echo
- ✅ Still can't handle the selector as a bind param
- ❌ Try to find simple way to fetch value inside variable for all combination (simple assignment or selector assignment). For example:

```go
req.Email = "emailz"
key := "some-key"
date := t.QueryParam(key)      // find the 'key' value
t.QueryParam(req.Email)        // find the 'req.Email' value

t.QueryParam(KEY)  // global var : var KEY string = "var-key"
t.QueryParam(KEY)  // const : const KEY string = "var-key"
```

### ✅ Decisions
- Search only for simple assignment like `key = "some-key"` or `var string key = "some-key"`
