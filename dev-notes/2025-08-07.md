## ðŸ“… [2025-08-07] - Unit test, Generate Comment Block

### ðŸ§ª Observation / What I Tried
- âœ… Add unit test with static node

---

### âœ… Decisions
- For function that need `types.Info`, using actual files and packages is preferable for more complex `Info` because it is more accurate and faster to develop.
