## ðŸ“… [2025-07-21] - Learn how to search registration

### ðŸ§ª Observation / What I Tried
- âœ… Using the `package.TypesInfo` to search for echo group registration
- âœ… Refactoring program
- âœ… Create benchmarking
- âœ… Found out (from benchmark) that the usage of "." and "./..." for `pakcage.Load` is responsible for the loading all the package but the `deps` for the config doesn't really add any difference except the load time 
---

### âœ… Decisions
- Because the `go/types` is used only for the function types, first node inspection is only for searching 
the function. Second inspection must be executed for searching the body ast of that function
