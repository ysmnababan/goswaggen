## 📅 [2025-07-17] - Learn GO/TYPES

### 🧪 Observation / What I Tried
- ❌ Experiment with Def and Uses object with `go/types` to find the types of a variable, but it couldn't resolve
      the import package for external library. Maybe need another setting.
- ✅ Using `go/package` for checking the types of a function using the `package.TypesInfo`

---

### ✅ Decisions
- Using `go/package` is slow so the program need to be optimized later on.
