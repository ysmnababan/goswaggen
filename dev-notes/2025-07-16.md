## ðŸ“… [2025-07-16] - Learn GO/PACKAGE

### ðŸ§ª Observation / What I Tried
- âœ… Experiment with Import with NeedDep mode with `ast/package`
- âœ… Using `go/package` for traversing the import is possible but takes time

---

### âœ… Decisions
- Using `go/package` is slow so the program need to be optimized later on.
