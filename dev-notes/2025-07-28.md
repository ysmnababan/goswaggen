## 📅 [2025-07-28] - Try to parse the func body

### 🧪 Observation / What I Tried
- ✅ Evaluate the string value for the `Param()` and `QueryParam()` binding function
- ❌ AST and `go/package` package can be used for value evaluation within function body. But for knowing the value of the variable from outside the function, more complex setup is needed, like the `ssa` package
---

### ✅ Decisions
- Because now it can handle the simple variable evaluation, it is enough for the MVP.
