## ðŸ“… [2025-07-29] - Try to parse the func body

### ðŸ§ª Observation / What I Tried
- âœ… Successfuly read and fetch each of a field for each `Bind()` param along with the tag field
- If a struct contains a imported field from external package, the `package.package` can't retrieve the declaration of that particular field
---

### âœ… Decisions
- Ignore the external package if it is used as a field in a struct.
