## 📅 [2025-07-07] - Learn AST (general capability)

### 🧪 Observation / What I Tried
- ✅ `go/ast` correctly detects `func (c *XController)` methods
- ✅ Correctly extract the importSpec part
- ✅ Function param from context is a pointer `&{echo Context}`. I expected `echo.Context`, same as the function
- ✅ Correctly detect the comment block
- ❌ Can't extract comment as a part of function documentation

---

### ✅ Decisions
- To detect type of handler (echo, gin, or net/http), parse the keyword `echo Context`
- Use the `ast.CommentGroup` and compare the line position to search corresponding block comment
