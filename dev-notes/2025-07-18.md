## ðŸ“… [2025-07-18] - Learn how to search registration

### ðŸ§ª Observation / What I Tried
- âœ… Using the `package.TypesInfo` to search for simple endpoint registration below:
      `e.GET("/next-test", handlerTest)`
	`e.POST("/dummy", dummyhandler.JustDummyHandler)`

---

### âœ… Decisions
- For now just searching the registration from the main.go file
- `go/types` package only provide the `object` info, so it needs to be inspected later on
