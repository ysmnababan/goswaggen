## ðŸ“… [2025-08-13] - Develop CLI Tool

### ðŸ§ª Observation / What I Tried
- âœ… Explore how to build cli tool in golang.
- âœ… Learn how to distribute the tooling later on.
- âœ… Research about how cli versioning is implemented.
---

### âœ… Decisions
- Building cli tools is quite simple by using `flag` and `os.Args` package. But there is a better and faster
  way to build it. That is by using `Cobra` library. https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/go/tutorials/cli-apps-go-cobra/creating_cli/
- The tooling distribution can be achieved using `goreleaser` and Github Action. This can be used for automatically publishing
  the related artifacts like native binaries and the `go install` for developer.native binaries and go install already cover the most cases. 
  The CLI itself is single static binary so no extra runtime needed. The other artifacts like docker and package manager can be added later on.
- Tagged artifacts stored in releases or registries let you roll back to v1.2.0 easily and compare behavior between versions. When native binaries is used, 
  need to reinstall but publishing to a package manager (Homebrew, Scoop/Chocolatey, APT/RPM) gives the easiest updates. 
  When it comes to the `go install` just use the go install with the latest version. This is the best for the developer how has the golang toolchain.
