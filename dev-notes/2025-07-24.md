## üìÖ [2025-07-24] - PREPARE FOR PARSING FUNCTION BODY

### üß™ Observation / What I Tried
- ‚úÖ Learn about how `ECHO` framework handle binding. This is useful for generating tag payload or query for the comment

| HTTP Method | Uses Body | Supports `json:"..."` | Supports `query:"..."` via `c.Bind()` | Notes                                                                                            |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GET**     | ‚ùå         | ‚ùå                     | ‚úÖ                                     | Binds only from **path** and **query** params. No body binding.                                  |
| **DELETE**  | ‚ùå         | ‚ùå                     | ‚úÖ                                     | Same as GET ‚Äî no body, query binding works.                                                      |
| **POST**    | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ                     | ‚ùå *(ignored unless manually fetched)* | Binds from **body** (JSON/form), **path**. Query must be fetched manually or with custom binder. |
| **PUT**     | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ                     | ‚ùå *(same as POST)*                    | Same as POST ‚Äî query not auto-bound.                                                             |
| **PATCH**   | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ                     | ‚ùå *(same as POST)*                    | Same as POST/PUT. Use `c.QueryParam(...)` for query strings.                                     |

    It is possible to specify multiple sources on the same field. In this case request data is bound in this order:
    - Path parameters
    - Query parameters (only for GET/DELETE methods)
    - Request body
